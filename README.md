# MeetUpPro 💼✨

**MeetUpPro** is a role-based online appointment and gig booking platform that connects users with professionals (gig holders) across various industries. The system supports three user roles: **Admin**, **Gig Holder**, and **User**, each with unique features and responsibilities.

## 🚀 Project Description

MeetUpPro aims to streamline the way services are booked and managed online. It provides an easy-to-use interface where:

- **Users** can discover gigs, book appointments, make secure payments, and communicate with service providers.
- **Gig Holders** can create professional profiles, set availability, manage bookings, and engage with users.
- **Admins** can manage platform content, categories, users, and monitor activity across the system.

This project is built using **Spring Boot**, **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, and **MySQL/Hibernate**, with full-stack integration between the frontend and backend.
